Problem sets are a very important part of 8.324. We believe that sitting down yourself and trying to reason your way through a problem not only helps you learn the material deeply, but also develops analytical tools fundamental to a successful career in science.

We recognize that students also learn a great deal from talking to and working with each other. We therefore encourage each student to make his/her own attempt on every problem and then, having done so, to discuss the problems with one another and collaborate on understanding them more fully. The solutions you submit must reflect your own work.

Some of the problems are assigned from the course textbooks:

Peskin, Michael E., and Daniel V. Schroeder. _An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory_. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1995. ISBN: 9780201503975.  
A comprehensive and pedagogical treatment of QFT starting from the basics and reaching up to the physics of the standard model.

Weinberg, S. _The Quantum Theory of Fields. Vol. 1: Foundations_. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1995. ISBN: 9780521550017.  
A comprehensive and insightful treatment of the foundations of QFT.

———. _The Quantum Theory of Fields. Vol. 2: Modern Applications_. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1996. ISBN: 9780521550024.  
A detailed presentation of advanced material.
