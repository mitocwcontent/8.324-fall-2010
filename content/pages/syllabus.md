Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Recitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session

Prerequisites
-------------

[_8.322 Quantum Theory II_](/courses/8-322-quantum-theory-ii-spring-2003) and [_8.323 Relativistic Quantum Field Theory I_](/courses/8-323-relativistic-quantum-field-theory-i-spring-2008)

Description
-----------

This course is the second course of the quantum field theory trimester sequence beginning with _Relativistic Quantum Field Theory I (8.323)_ and ending with _Relativistic Quantum Field Theory III (8.325)_. It develops in depth some of the topics discussed in 8.323 and introduces some advanced material.

Texts
-----

Three books will be used in this course.

Peskin, Michael E., and Daniel V. Schroeder. _An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory_. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1995. ISBN: 9780201503975.  
A comprehensive and pedagogical treatment of QFT starting from the basics and reaching up to the physics of the standard model.

Weinberg, S. _The Quantum Theory of Fields. Vol. 1: Foundations_. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1995. ISBN: 9780521550017.  
A comprehensive and insightful treatment of the foundations of QFT.

———. _The Quantum Theory of Fields. Vol. 2: Modern Applications_. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1996. ISBN: 9780521550024.  
A detailed presentation of advanced material.

Assignments, Exams, Grading
---------------------------

There are no exams for this course. The course grade will be based 100% on the eight homework assignments. The faculty may alter grades to reflect class participation, improvement, effort and other qualitative measures of performance.
